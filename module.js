/**
 * # SVG
 *
 * Allows you to replace an element with SVG.  This can be used with 2 different libraries.  A free library that can be used is https://github.com/iconic/SVGInjector.  If you have a license to the Iconic icon library, you can also include the iconic.js file without the SVG injector and this library will also work.
 *
 * It is possible that there will be a separate iconic component but we will have to wait an see.
